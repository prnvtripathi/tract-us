  "parties": [{"name": "Party Name", "role": "Buyer/Seller/Licensor/etc", "contact_info": "email or address if available"}],
  "dates": {
    "effective_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
    "termination_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
    "renewal_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
    "signature_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null"
  },
  "obligations": [{"party": "Party Name", "text": "Obligation description", "deadline": "date if any", "category": "payment/delivery/maintenance/etc"}],
  "financial_terms": [{"amount": "dollar amount", "currency": "USD/EUR/etc", "frequency": "monthly/annual/one-time", "description": "what the payment is for"}],

  },
  "confidence_score": 0.0-1.0,

3. List all financial obligations and payment terms.
4. Highlight responsibilities of each party.
5. Identify risks or concerning clauses.
